## What is Next.js ?

- The React Framework for Production

### React

- Not quite possible to build a full feature rich application ready to be deployed for production

- now if you think about building applications with just react

- you know that it's not quite possible to build a full feature-rich application ready to be deployed for production

- react is a library for building user interfaces

- it is responsible for only the view layer of an application and you as the developer have to make decisions on other features of the app

- for example how would you implement routing, styling authentication etc

### Next.js

- next.js on the other hand is a react framework

- so it is a package that uses react for building user interfaces

- but it also comes loaded with a lot more features that enable you to build full-fledged production ready applications

- features exactly like routing, styling, authentication, bundle optimization etc

- there's no need to install additional packages

- next.js provides everything for you

- you do have to keep in mind though that next.js living true to the name of being a framework does have opinions and conventions which need to be followed to implement the above set features

- however we don't have to worry much about that as there are conventions that have emerged from a team with years of experience writing react apps for production

- so to reiterate next.js is a react framework for building production ready applications

## Why learn Next.js ?

- the why again stems from the fact that next.js simplifies the process of building a react application for production

- let me list down some of the noteworthy features which you would probably want in a react application which next js provides out of the box

### 1. File based routing

- when building a react app you need to install a third-party routing package configure it and add code every time you need to create a route

- next js provides what is known as file based routing to simplify this task

### 2. Pre-rendering

- this means that next js generates html for each page in advance

- instead of having it all done by client-side javascript

- pre-rendering can result in better performance and seo which is something we all want

### 3. API routes

- this might be a surprise to most of you

- but you can create apis with next js

- so next js is really a full stack framework if you think about it

- you can write the frontend code in react but also write apis that can be called by the react app

### 4. Support for CSS modules

- next js also supports css modules which saves you the time of choosing a css library

- of course you are allowed to use a css framework like tailwind or even a css in js library like style components for example

- but next js supports css modules out of the box

### 5. Authentication

- next js supports multiple authentication patterns

- each designed for different use cases

### 6. Dev and Prod build system

- next.js provides a dev and build system and a well optimized production build system so that you can focus more on the code and less on the configuration

- it is a culmination of all these features which makes next.js an amazing framework to work with

- and if you haven't guessed already these are the features you're going to learn in detail throughout the series

- also just so you know i might refer to next js as just next many times in the series so please don't get confused
